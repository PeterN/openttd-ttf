# OpenTTD Sans
OpenTTD Sans is a heavy regular typeface designed for medium-sized text in a pixel art style. Drawn to broadly capture the look and feel of the medium pixel font in Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

The glyphs are designed with a pixel art aesthetic, heavily aligned to a pixel grid but with some flourishes for character. Pixel-perfect appearance when rendered at a height of 10 pixel (or multiples thereof).

The small ascender height and heavy weight give a dense, compact feel. This is enhanced by the peculiarity of majuscules with diacritics being compressed to fit the diacritic within the ascender space.

## Unicode coverage
OpenTTD Sans uses Unicode basic multilingual plane encoding.

Full coverage:
* Basic Latin (`U+0000..U+007F`)
* Latin-1 Supplement (`U+0080..U+00FF`)
* Latin Extended-A (`U+0100..U+017F`)
* Currency Symbols (`U+20A0..U+20CF`)

Targeted coverage:
* Greek and Coptic (`U+0384..U+03D7`) [contempary Greek only `U+0370..U+03FF`]

Partial coverage:
* IPA Extensions (`U+0250–U+02AF`)
* Combining Diacritical Marks (`U+0300–U+036F`)
These ranges provide glyphs which are combined to build the full coverage core set.

Plus a few additional glyphs - stray small caps and glyphs of particular use in OpenTTD.

## Features
OpenTTD Sans is designed with the creation of standalone bitmap strikes in mind, for example for generation of an image/sprite-based font.
This comes with some pixel "charm", like some unusual character spacing and off-centre diacritics.

When used as a vector font, it comes with the usual improvements:
* Character pair kerning
* Select ligatures/contextual alternates

## Technical details
SVG glyphs are drawn in Inkscape, for manual import into FontForge. Source SVGs, occasionally containing source paths pre-union, are included for convenience.

In FontForge, glyphs are composed from referenced copies wherever possible. Majuscule diacritics are generally placed on a "small caps" letter variant.

### Glyph units
SVGs are prepared at 1 pixel = 1 unit
* height: 1200 units
* baseline offset: 200 units
* x height: 600 units
* ascender: 200 units
* ascent: 900 units
* descender: 200 units
* overshoot: 0 units
The top 100 units are always empty. During TTF generation from the FontForge SFD file, height is set to 1000.

Bearings are optimised for pixel-perfect rendering:
* left bearing: 0 units
* right bearing: 100 units
And, kerning adjusts spacing in steps of 100 units.

Diacritics are similarly positioned in steps of 100 units. This can lead to them being off-centre.

This is designed for rendering at 10 pixel height:
* line height: 10 pixel
* baseline offset: 2 pixel
* x height: 6 pixel
* ascender: 2 pixel
* ascent: 9 pixel
* descender: 2 pixel

The recommended line height of 10 pixel is smaller than the glyph height of up to 11 pixel. It is intended for diacritics to overflow out of the top of the 10 pixel line height.

### Building
Run `build.sh` to build the output TTD and OTF files.

The master source file is the FontForge SFD file. SVG files are not automatically imported.
